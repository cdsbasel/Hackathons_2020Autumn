## Time

October 30th, 2pm–6pm

## Learning Goals
The half-day hackathon uses the principles of problem-based learning and service learning to train your skills in data analysis and communication of evidence - key competencies in the digital era.

## Background and Client Needs
The client contacted the Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences (CDS) with a data analytics problem - help the client validate a stress measure that can be used to identify institutions or individuals that are experiencing problematic levels of stress and could be targets of intervention programs. Before approaching CDS, the client had already decided to pursue this project in an evidence-based manner by relying on a questionnaire and collecting data from a number of customers. The client, however, lacked expertise to perform an evaluation of the psychometric characteristics of the instrument and decided to get help from academics to evaluate the construct validity of the stress inventory to the extent possible given the available data.

## Problem/Questions
Your assignment is to function as a data analyst to identify a course of action, including developing a specific analysis plan and communication strategy. You are challenged to answer a number of questions, such as: How can one demonstrate the inventory’s validity? What qualitative or quantitative procedures can be used for this purpose? What visualization or statistical procedures would you recommend? How should such procedures and analyses be conducted, communicated, and interpreted?

## Inventory and Data
The inventory consists of 10 items with three different five-option, graded response formats rated from 1 to 5. Currently, the items are averaged to compute a score indicating the person’s stress level. According to the client’s current scoring rules, scores between 1 and 2 are interpreted as excellent, scores between 2 and 3 as balanced, scores between 3 and 4 as somewhat stressed, and scores between 4 and 5 as very stressed. There are 1,485 responses stemming from six different assessment contexts.
